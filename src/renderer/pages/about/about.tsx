        On the left is navigation with links to pages, and the content will be
        on the right.
      </p>
      <h3 id="navigation">
        <strong>Navigation</strong>:
      </h3>
      <p>
        <img src={navigation} alt="" />
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        The pie chart will show the ratio of expired and active subscriptions.
        The bottom table is showing subscriptions that are 3 days or less to
        expire sorted by most recent to expire. If there is no data this page
        will be blank.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3 id="users-page">
        <strong>Users page:</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <img src={userPage} alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>This is a table of all users.</p>
      <p>
        The table can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on
        the header items.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the top left corner is a search input that allows the table to be
        searched with a name or last name.
      </p>
      <p>
        The table shows basic information and the status of the subscription:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>RED: expired;</li>
        <li>YELLOW: 3 or fewer days until expiring;</li>
        <li>GREEN: active</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On the right are quick actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          PLUS: If there are subscription models it will add the first one in
          the list, if there are none subscription models it will add a one
          month from the date the subscription is set to expire;
        </li>
        <li>
          TRASH CAN: This will delete a user PERMANENTLY with all data. This
          action will trigger a confirm dialog:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <img src={dialog} alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        In the top right corder is &quot;add new user&quot; button wich will
        open a modal to fill out the data of the new user:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src={addUserModal} alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        First name and last name fields are only ones that are required. Note is
        a general field that can be used to insert and text or number.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Subscription&quot; select will get data from subscription models
        page and fill in the dropdown:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src={subscriptionDropdown} alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        This drop down will only apply first time. Idea is to create a standard
        one that will be added by default when plus in the actions column of the
        users table is pressed and add models here for give aways or coupons or
        grace periods. If t he user wants some other subscription the used view
        can be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking on the user will open a more detailed modal with the option to
        edit fields and insert custom subscriptions:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src={userModal} alt="User modal" />
      </p>
      <h3 id="subscription-models">
        <strong>Subscription models</strong>:
      </h3>
      <p>
        <img src={modelsTable} alt="Subscription models" />
      </p>
      <p>This is a table of all subscription models.</p>
      <p>
        The table can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on
        the header items.
      </p>
      <p>The table shows information about subscription models.</p>
      <p>On the right are quick actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          TRASH CAN: This will delete a user PERMANENTLY with all data. This
          action will trigger a confirm dialog:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Subscription model consists of name (should be as descriptive as
        possible), value wich is a number that is tied to modifier that can be
        day, month, or year.
      </p>
      <p>
        New models are created by clicking the &quot;Insert new model&quot;
        button in the top right:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src={modelsModal} alt="subscription model modal" />
      </p>
      <p>
        To create a new subscription that will last a week for example first we
        would insert new name:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &quot;Week sub&quot; (name can not be duplicate and will throw a error
          if you try to insert a subscription with same name)
        </li>
        <li>
          Then we would select a value - 7 (value is a number that can not be
          less then 1).
        </li>
        <li>After that select modifier - days</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That will give us a subscription named &quot;Week sub&quot; that will
        last for 7 days (a week).
      </p>
      <p>
        !! <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> !! maximum amount of subscription models
        to add is 6. After that the button to add new one will not be
        functional. This is made to prevent making too much of the models.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <ul>
        <li>**Error message: **</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <img src={error} alt="error message" />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you see this message something went wrong. If you have trouble
